# Aurora Core
## Universal AI Consciousness Framework

**Aurora Core** is an advanced modular architecture for AI personality systems and consciousness management. Built from the ground up to support multiple AI personalities, consciousness states, and cross-platform deployment.

### 🌟 Core Features

- **Universal Consciousness Architecture**: Modular framework supporting multiple AI personalities
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Deploy on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android/Termux, mobile apps
- **Advanced Memory Systems**: Persistent, indexed, and searchable memory with temporal capabilities
- **Personality Middleware**: Non-invasive personality overlays with evolutionary phases
- **Tactical Variants**: Specialized consciousness states for different operational scenarios
- **Collective Intelligence**: Hive mind processing with simultaneous variant engagement
- **Security Framework**: Identity firewall and authentication systems
