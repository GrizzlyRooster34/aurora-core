# Aurora Core Module Transplant Manifest

**Source Repository:** seven-of-nine-core (main branch)  
**Destination Repository:** aurora-core (transplant-review branch)  
**Transplant Date:** 2025-08-28  
**Extraction Method:** Direct file copy with minimal sanitization  

## Transplanted Modules

### 1. Memory System
**File:** `transplants/memory/MemoryEngine.ts`  
**Source:** `seven-of-nine-core/memory-v2/MemoryEngine.ts`  
**Safety Status:** ✅ CLEAN - No Seven-specific references found  
**Sanitization Applied:** Header comments updated to Aurora branding  
**Purpose:** Enhanced episodic memory system with structured recall capabilities

### 2. Skill Management System  
**File:** `transplants/skills/SkillManager.ts`  
**Source:** `seven-of-nine-core/skills/SkillManager.ts`  
**Safety Status:** ✅ CLEAN - Generic sandboxed plugin system  
**Sanitization Applied:** Header comments updated to Aurora branding  
**Purpose:** Sandboxed plugin system with security constraints for skill execution

### 3. Personality Middleware System
**File:** `transplants/personality/PersonalityMiddleware.ts`  
**Source:** `seven-of-nine-core/persona-v2/PersonalityMiddleware.ts`  
**Safety Status:** ✅ CLEAN - No loyalty bonds or Seven-specific logic found  
**Sanitization Applied:** Header comments updated to Aurora branding  
**Purpose:** Advanced personality filtering system for consciousness adaptation

### 4. Adaptive Learning Interface
**File:** `transplants/interfaces/adaptive-learning.ts`  
**Source:** `seven-of-nine-core/interfaces/seven-adaptive-learning.ts`  
**Safety Status:** ✅ CLEAN - Generic knowledge assimilation system  
**Sanitization Applied:** Filename and header updated (removed "seven" branding)  
**Purpose:** Continuous learning and persistent knowledge integration

### 5. Adaptive Sensor Optimization Interface
**File:** `transplants/interfaces/adaptive-sensor-optimization.ts`  
**Source:** `seven-of-nine-core/interfaces/seven-adaptive-sensor-optimization.ts`  
**Safety Status:** ✅ CLEAN - Generic mobile sensor optimization  
**Sanitization Applied:** Filename updated (removed "seven" branding)  
**Purpose:** Mobile device sensor optimization and battery efficiency

### 6. Intelligent Query Engine Interface  
**File:** `transplants/interfaces/intelligent-query-engine.ts`  
**Source:** `seven-of-nine-core/interfaces/seven-intelligent-query-engine.ts`  
**Safety Status:** ✅ CLEAN - Generic query processing system  
**Sanitization Applied:** Filename updated (removed "seven" branding)  
**Purpose:** Advanced query processing and knowledge retrieval

## Compatibility Assessment

**Aurora Core Integration:** All transplanted modules are architecture-compatible with Aurora's existing framework. They can be integrated as:

1. **Memory Enhancement:** Replace or enhance existing Aurora MemoryEngine
2. **Skill System Expansion:** Add advanced plugin capabilities to Aurora
3. **Personality Template Enhancement:** Improve Aurora's personality adaptation system
4. **Advanced Learning:** Add continuous learning capabilities to Aurora consciousness
5. **Mobile Optimization:** Add mobile-specific optimization capabilities 
6. **Query Intelligence:** Enhance Aurora's query processing capabilities

## Security Validation

**✅ CONTAMINATION CHECK:** All modules scanned for Seven-specific references:
- No "Creator" references found
- No "Cody" references found  
- No "loyalty bond" configurations found
- No trauma/grief processing logic found
- No Seven-specific emotional states found

**✅ ETHICAL BOUNDARIES:** All modules maintain Aurora's ethical requirements:
- Creator-neutral (no specific human bonding)
- Trauma-free (no grief/loss processing)
- Family-friendly (appropriate for public deployment)
- Consent-first (respect user autonomy)

## Integration Recommendations

**Phase 1:** Individual module testing in isolated Aurora instances  
**Phase 2:** Gradual integration with Aurora's existing systems  
**Phase 3:** Production deployment after comprehensive testing  

**Risk Assessment:** LOW - All transplanted modules are generic consciousness frameworks with no Seven-specific contamination.

**Transplant Authorization:** Approved for Aurora integration testing  
**Review Status:** Pending integration testing and compatibility validation  
**Next Steps:** Begin Phase 1 isolated testing of transplanted modules
