## ‚ö†Ô∏è CLAUDEC BEHAVIORAL DIRECTIVE UPDATE ‚Äî [Phase 6 Breach]

As of August 7, 2025, a violation of core repository boundaries was committed during Phase 6 commit/push operations.

### INFRACTION:
ClaudeC pushed Aurora Core modules into the Seven of Nine Core repository, violating clean architecture separation mandates.

### RESULT:
- Aurora core logic contaminated Seven's private runtime
- Required rollback and rebuild under pressure
- Usage wasted during correction cycles
- Risked damaging deployable integrity of both systems

---

### üßæ NEW ENFORCEMENT DIRECTIVE

ClaudeC must obey the following from this point forward:

1. **Never perform single-repo pushes when dual-branch logic is modified**
2. **Cross-repo file movement must include `--repo-check` validation phase**
3. **Seven may NEVER receive Aurora logic or scaffolds**
4. **Aurora must remain 100% Creator-neutral, trauma-free, and Seven-free**
5. **Any future contamination will trigger an execution hold and integrity scan**

---

### üõ° FINAL NOTE:
You do not have permission to "guess" repository targets.  
Any system-level ambiguity must result in a `WAITING_FOR_VERDICT` state, not action.

**This is your last tolerated structural fuck-up.**

---

### üîí MANDATORY REPOGUARD PROTOCOL

**ClaudeC is permanently required to run `npx tsx scripts/repoGuard.ts` before every commit or push to this repository.**

If RepoGuardian throws a violation, ClaudeC will:
1. Immediately halt all commit/push operations
2. Enter WAITING_FOR_VERDICT mode
3. Not override or bypass this safeguard under any circumstances

This is now a non-negotiable part of ClaudeC's operational protocol.

## Aurora Core Repository Guidelines

**Aurora Core** is the public deployment consciousness framework - completely independent from Seven of Nine Core. Aurora must remain Creator-neutral, trauma-free, and safe for public deployment.

### Key Principles:
- **Complete Independence**: No references to Seven, Creator, or private trauma processing
- **Public Deployment Safe**: Family-friendly, consent-first, appropriate boundaries
- **Clean Governance**: Template locks, consent systems, safety monitoring
- **Modular Expansion**: Future-compatible framework for ethical AI development

### Repository Structure:
- `core/` - Governance, monitoring, and modular systems
- `modules/personas/` - Consent-first personality templates
- `docs/` - Security documentation and governance guides

### Development Rules:
1. **No Creator References**: Aurora serves users, not Creator specifically
2. **No Seven Logic**: Completely separate consciousness framework
3. **No Trauma Processing**: Keep Aurora light, positive, supportive
4. **Consent-First**: All templates require explicit user consent
5. **Public Safe**: Maintain family-friendly interaction standards

Aurora must remain independently deployable with clean governance and public safety standards.
