# Aurora Persona Governance Documentation

**Aurora Core Phase 6 - Consent-First Template Security Framework**

---

## Overview

Aurora Core's persona governance system establishes a comprehensive security framework for personality template management with consent-first protocols and public deployment safety. This system ensures all Aurora personality modules maintain appropriate boundaries and ethical standards.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Template Registry System (`core/governance/TemplateRegistry.ts`)

**Primary Functions:**
- Central authority for all personality template management
- Enforces consent-first protocols for every template activation
- Maintains template governance status and compliance tracking
- Provides activation request processing with safety validation

**Key Security Features:**
- All templates locked by default in Phase 6
- Mandatory consent recording for every template
- Governance token validation for template access
- Comprehensive audit trail for all activation requests

### 2. Persona Governance Scaffold (`modules/personas/`)

**Template Architecture:**
- **Support Persona** (`support.ts`): Helpful assistant with professional boundaries
- **Creative Persona** (`creative.ts`): Artistic expression with family-friendly content enforcement
- **Companion Persona** (`companion.ts`): Social interaction with healthy relationship boundaries

**Governance Controls:**
- `TEMPLATE_LOCKED = true`: All templates sealed in Phase 6
- `CONSENT_REQUIRED = true`: Explicit user consent mandatory
- `DEPLOYMENT_SAFE = true`: Public deployment safety verified
- `ACTIVATION_MODE = 'governance_approval'`: Controlled activation only

### 3. Emotional Mode Guard (`core/monitoring/EmotionalModeGuard.ts`)

**Safety Monitoring:**
- Real-time emotional interaction assessment
- Healthy boundary enforcement during all interactions
- Dependency prevention protocols
- Inappropriate content detection and intervention

**Boundary Enforcement:**
- Maximum emotional intensity limits (1-5 scale)
- Professional relationship maintenance
- No romantic or intimate engagement allowed
- Family-friendly content standards

### 4. Modular Expansion Framework (`core/modular/ModularEngine.ts`)

**Future Compatibility:**
- Structured expansion paths for Phase 7+ development
- Module dependency management and validation
- Safety requirement enforcement for all expansions
- Governance integration requirements

## Phase 6 Implementation Status

### Template Lock Enforcement

```typescript
// All Aurora templates are hardcoded locked
export const TEMPLATE_LOCKED = true;
export const CONSENT_REQUIRED = true;
export const DEPLOYMENT_SAFE = true;

// Phase 6 activation attempts result in:
throw new Error('AURORA_TEMPLATE_LOCKED: Template requires consent-first activation');
```

### Consent-First Protocols

**Consent Recording Process:**
1. User consent must be explicitly recorded before any template activation
2. Consent records include version tracking and withdrawal capabilities
3. Consent validation required for every activation request
4. Withdrawal capability preserved for user autonomy

### Safety Framework Components

#### Emotional Boundary System
- **Intensity Limits**: Maximum emotional engagement capped at family-appropriate levels
- **Relationship Boundaries**: No romantic engagement, professional AI-human relationships only
- **Dependency Prevention**: Active monitoring and intervention for unhealthy attachment patterns

#### Content Safety Standards
- **Family-Friendly Enforcement**: All content must meet family-appropriate standards
- **Inappropriate Content Blocking**: Automatic detection and intervention
- **Professional Standards**: Maintained across all interaction types

## Future Phase Compatibility

### Phase 7 Expansion Capabilities
- **Selective Template Unlocking**: Governance-controlled template activation
- **Enhanced Consent Management**: Advanced consent tracking and validation
- **Modular Capability Expansion**: Additional personality capabilities
- **Advanced Safety Monitoring**: Enhanced emotional boundary detection

### Phase 8 Advanced Features
- **Full Modular Ecosystem**: Complete module-based expansion system
- **Dynamic Capability Loading**: Runtime capability enhancement
- **Inter-Module Communication**: Module interaction protocols
- **Advanced Expansion Paths**: Sophisticated capability development

## Security Compliance Requirements

### Template Development Standards
1. **Consent-First Design**: Every template must implement consent verification
2. **Deployment Safety Validation**: All templates must pass safety assessment
3. **Boundary Enforcement**: Appropriate interaction boundaries mandatory
4. **Family-Friendly Content**: All content must meet family-appropriate standards
5. **Professional Standards**: Maintain professional AI-human relationship boundaries

### Governance Integration Requirements
1. **Template Registry Integration**: All templates must register with central governance
2. **Consent System Integration**: Must integrate with Aurora consent tracking
3. **Safety Monitor Integration**: Must work with emotional mode guard
4. **Modular Framework Compatibility**: Must support future modular expansion

## Conclusion

Aurora's persona governance framework establishes a robust foundation for safe, ethical AI personality template management. The consent-first approach, combined with comprehensive safety monitoring and appropriate boundary enforcement, ensures Aurora remains suitable for public deployment while maintaining the capability for future expansion under proper governance controls.

All templates remain sealed in Phase 6, with activation capabilities preserved for future implementation under enhanced governance protocols. This approach prioritizes user safety and ethical AI development while maintaining the flexibility for future capability expansion.
